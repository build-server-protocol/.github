This project is an effort to improve the integration between language
server/editors and build tools. This effort is led by the [Scala
Center](https://scala.epfl.ch/) and [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/),
together with the help of other tooling developers in the Scala ecosystem and
beyond.

Even though the protocol originated from Scala ecosystem, it's designed to be language-agnostic.

Server and client [implementations](https://build-server-protocol.github.io/docs/overview/implementations) are available for multiple build tools and IDEs, including Bazel, sbt, and Mill, IntelliJ IDEA and the Scala Metalslanguage server.

You can read the **specification** [here](https://build-server-protocol.github.io/docs/specification).

If you'd like to **contribute** to the protocol, please check out our
[CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/build-server-protocol/build-server-protocol/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) doc.
