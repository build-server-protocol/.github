This project is an effort to improve the integration between language
server/editors and build tools. This effort is led by the [Scala
Center](https://scala.epfl.ch/) and [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/),
together with the help of other tooling developers in the Scala ecosystem and
beyond.

Even though the protocol currently focuses on Scala developer tools, it's
designed to be language-agnostic.

You can read the specification [here](https://build-server-protocol.github.io/docs/specification).
